Memory Placement Strategies: Best Fit and Worst Fit
In memory management, the way memory is allocated to processes affects both the system's performance and efficiency. Best Fit and Worst Fit are two strategies used for memory allocation. Here's an explanation of both:

Best Fit: Allocates a process to the memory block that leaves the least leftover space.
Worst Fit: Allocates a process to the memory block that leaves the most leftover space.
Program Overview:
We will simulate both Best Fit and Worst Fit memory allocation strategies:

Memory Blocks: Represented by an array of available memory blocks.
Processes: Represented by an array of processes that need memory space.
The program will allocate memory to processes using both Best Fit and Worst Fit strategies and display the results.







Explanation of the Code:
Memory Blocks and Processes:

Memory Blocks: A list of available blocks of memory (e.g., 100, 500, 200, 300, 600).
Processes: A list of processes with memory requirements (e.g., 212, 417, 112, 426).
Best Fit Allocation:

For each process, the program searches for the memory block that leaves the least unused space after allocation.
The block with the smallest remaining space is selected for allocation.
After a block is allocated, its size is updated.
Worst Fit Allocation:

For each process, the program searches for the memory block that leaves the most unused space after allocation.
The block with the largest remaining space is selected for allocation.
Once allocated, the block's size is reduced accordingly.
Display Results:

After allocation, the program prints the results: for each process, the allocated memory block and its corresponding size. If no block is found, it prints that the process is not allocated.

Best Fit Allocation:
Process 1 (Size 212) allocated to Block 3
Process 2 (Size 417) allocated to Block 5
Process 3 (Size 112) allocated to Block 1
Process 4 (Size 426) allocated to Block 4

Worst Fit Allocation:
Process 1 (Size 212) allocated to Block 5
Process 2 (Size 417) allocated to Block 2
Process 3 (Size 112) allocated to Block 4
Process 4 (Size 426) allocated to Block 3
Explanation of Output:
Best Fit:
The program allocates the processes to the memory blocks in such a way that the leftover space is minimized. For example, Process 1 (212 units) is allocated to Block 3 (200 units), leaving the smallest leftover space compared to other blocks.
Worst Fit:
The program allocates the processes to the memory blocks in such a way that the leftover space is maximized. For instance, Process 1 (212 units) is allocated to Block 5 (600 units), leaving the largest leftover space.
Conclusion:
This program simulates the Best Fit and Worst Fit memory allocation strategies, where processes are allocated to memory blocks based on different criteria:

Best Fit minimizes leftover space.
Worst Fit maximizes leftover space.
Each strategy has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the type of workload and memory requirements. Best Fit may reduce fragmentation over time, while Worst Fit might be beneficial when large blocks are more likely to be used.
